\title{Weather data from one measuring station.}
\format{
A data frame with the following of variables: 

\describe{
\item{\code{DATE_CET}}{The date and time of the weather observation in Central European Time}
\item{\code{WEEK}}{Week of the year as decimal number (00â€“53) using Monday as the first day of week}
\item{\code{WIND_DIRECTION}}{Wind direction in compass degrees.
  *NA* when air is calm (no wind speed)}
\item{\code{CLOUD_CEILING}}{Lowest opaque layer with 5/8 or greater
  coverage}
\item{\code{SKY_COVER}}{Sky cover: CLR-clear, SCT-scattered (1/8 to 4/8),
  BKN-broken (5/8 to 7/8), OVC-overcast, OBS-obscured, POB-partial obscuration}
\item{\code{VISIBILITY}}{Visibilityin statute miles (rounded to nearest tenth)}
\item{\code{TEMP}}{Temperature measured in fahrenheit}
\item{\code{SEA_LEVEL_PRESSURE}}{Sea level pressure measured in millibars (rounded to nearest tenth)}
\item{\code{STATION_PRESSURE}}{Station pressure measured in millibars (rounded to nearest tenth)}
\item{\code{PCP01}}{1-hour liquid precip reportin inches and hundredths,
  that is, the precip for the preceding 1-hour period}
\item{\code{WIND_SPEED}}{Wind speed in miles per hour}

\description{
Weather data from a weather station in a central location of the study region. The
data contains hourly measurements over a period of ten weeks, similar to the time span 
of the dataset *elcons_15min*. Weather data are averaged across all available weather 
stations in the study area for each unit of time.
}
\details{
This data cannot be used or redistributed for commercial purposes. Re-distribution 
of these data by others must provide this same notification.

\examples{
data(elcons_15min, weather_data)

#transform 15-minute electricity measurements to hourly consumption values
hourly_cons <- colSums(matrix(t(elcons_15min$w44[1,2:673]), nrow=4))

#select temperature observations for week 44
hourly_temp <- weather_data[weather_data$WEEK==44,"TEMP"]

#compute correlation
cor(hourly_cons, hourly_temp)
